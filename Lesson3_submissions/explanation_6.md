## Problem 6: Unsorted Integer Array

#### Algorithm - Simple Traversal
We just traverse the given array and update `minimum` & `maximum` as needed.

 
#### Complexity Discussion
* Time Complexity: O(n) as there is a single pass
* (Additional) Space Complexity: O(1) as we just create two variables that store integer values and get returned at the end
